    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "For `human-in-the-loop`, we often want to see our graph outputs as its running. \n",
    "\n",
    "We laid the foundations for this with streaming. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's talk about the motivations for `human-in-the-loop`:\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) `Approval` - We can interrupt our agent, surface state to a user, and allow the user to accept an action\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) `Debugging` - We can rewind the graph to reproduce or avoid issues\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) `Editing` - You can modify the state \n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph offers several ways to get or update agent state to support various `human-in-the-loop` workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll introduce [breakpoints](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints/#simple-usage), which provide a simple way to stop the graph at specific steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll show how this enables user `approval`."

    "# Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What LangGraph is (in 60 seconds)\n",
    "* Graphs, not chains. You model your app as a stateful directed graph: nodes are functions (or subgraphs), edges decide what runs next.\n",
    "* ingle shared state. Nodes read from and return partial updates to a shared state object (usually a TypedDict or Pydantic model). LangGraph merges those partial updates for you.\n",
    "* erministic control flow. You wire START → nodes → END. You can add conditional edges for branching and subgraphs for composition.\n",
    "* sistence + threads. Every step is checkpointed; runs are grouped into threads so you can pause/resume later and recover state safely. This is the foundation for human-in-the-loop.  ￼\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core primitives (the mental model)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from typing import TypedDict\n",
    "\n",
    "class State(TypedDict):\n",
    "    messages: list   # or any keys you need\n",
    "```\n",
    "Nodes return partial updates. If a node returns {\"messages\": [...]}, only messages changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def plan(state: State) -> dict:\n",
    "    # read state, compute, return an update\n",
    "    return {\"messages\": state[\"messages\"] + [\"plan ready\"]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Edges & compilation\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END\n",
    "\n",
    "builder = StateGraph(State)\n",
    "builder.add_node(\"plan\", plan)\n",
    "builder.add_edge(START, \"plan\")\n",
    "builder.add_edge(\"plan\", END)\n",
    "graph = builder.compile()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Running\n",
    "\n",
    "**chronous**: graph.invoke(inputs)\n",
    "**Streaming**: for chunk in graph.stream(inputs, stream_mode=...): ...\n",
    "\n",
    "## Streaming 101: stream_mode=\"values\" vs \"updates\"\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph can stream intermediate progress:\n",
    "* **\"values\"** → after each step, you get the entire current state (full snapshot).\n",
    "* **\"dates\"** → you get only the delta for that step (incremental updates). If a step runs multiple nodes, you can see multiple small updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical usage you’ll see in examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode=\"values\"):\n",
    "    # event is the full state snapshot after each step\n",
    "\n",
    "for event in graph.stream(inputs, thread, stream_mode=\"updates\"):\n",
    "    # event is just the change(s) made in that step\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule of thumb:\n",
    "* Use updates for tight progress UIs (less data, easier to diff).\n",
    "*  values for debugging when you want to inspect the whole state each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL): the key idea\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph lets you pause the graph at defined points, gather human input/approval, then resume exactly where you left off because state is checkpointed per thread. There are two main patterns:\n",
    "* **Declarative “breakpoints” around nodes**\n",
    "Add interrupt_before=[\"tools\"] (or specific node names) so the graph automatically pauses before those nodes run.\n",
    "* **grammatic interrupts inside a node**\n",
    "Call interrupt(...) in node code to pause with your own custom payload and wait for a resume.  ￼ ￼\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful to approve tool calls (e.g., “Send email?”, “Buy flight?”) or to ask the user a clarifying question before continuing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mapping to your uploaded notebook (breakpoints.ipynb)￼\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook demonstrates two complementary flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local graph streaming + manual approval\n",
    "    * builds an agent-like graph (LLM + tools), then runs:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for event in graph.stream(initial_input, thread, stream_mode=\"values\"):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "\n",
    "user_approval = input(\"Do you want to call the tool? (yes/no): \")\n",
    "if user_approval.lower() == \"yes\":\n",
    "    # resume the graph from the pause point\n",
    "    for event in graph.stream(None, thread, stream_mode=\"values\"):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Operation cancelled by user.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s happening:\n",
    "    * First .stream(...) progresses until it hits the interrupt (configured to pause before running tools).\n",
    "    * You ask the human for approval.\n",
    "    * If approved, call .stream(None, thread, ...) again to resume. Because LangGraph persists checkpoints per thread, it continues from exactly where it paused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Platform/SDK streaming with server-side runs\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook also shows using the LangGraph SDK:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async for chunk in client.runs.stream(\n",

    "* Threads are your friend. Always run with a thread_id so you can pause/resume later without losing context.  ￼\n",
    "* Programmatic interrupt() is perfect when you need to pause inside logic (e.g., “I need a date range from the user”).  ￼\n",
    "* Server vs local. Locally, call graph.stream(...). When deployed, use client.runs.stream(...) with the same stream_mode and interrupt_before flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What you should take away\n",
    "1. Model your app as nodes that return partial state updates; wire them with edges; compile.\n",
    "2. Use stream_mode=\"updates\" for progress UIs; \"values\" for full snapshots.  ￼\n",
    "3. Enable HITL with interrupts (before specific nodes or from inside nodes) and resume using the same thread. This is reliable because LangGraph saves checkpoints every step.  ￼ ￼\n",
